# GEOCLE-APP

**Version 1.0.0**

In this project I have learned a lots of things. I learned how to make a map application using JavaScript library which was leaflet.js and how to use API with Mapbox Static Tiles API. Next thing that I learned was SCSS basics for styling buttons purposes. When I needed help, I reached out to YouTube tutorial videos, StackOverflow and MDN. That project was a lot of fun, it's still not ideal, but for me it's a really good achievement :D. I've never been so involved in anything before, when I was waking up I was thinking about project, same thing when I was going to sleep, I was watching tutorials with great interest to apply them to my project like never before.
The filtering isn't working properly, I couldn't make it in 100%, but I tried my best. For whole week I was making progress in my project, day by day, when I came back from school at 4PM I was working on this app for 3 hours at least, at weekend it was at least 7 hours. The project was very fun and I can tell I was living this for whole week :D

# What does this project have?
